**Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library used to create and manage tabular data. In this code, it is used to store movie ratings in a DataFrame, reshape the data into a user-item matrix using pivot_table, and perform filtering and sorting operations.

Scikit-learn (sklearn) provides machine learning tools. Here, cosine_similarity from sklearn.metrics.pairwise is used to calculate the similarity between users based on their movie rating patterns.

StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing is imported (though not used in this version), typically used for scaling numerical values when needed.

These tools together help build a basic user-based collaborative filtering recommendation system, where user similarities are calculated, and personalized movie suggestions are generated based on ratings from similar users.
